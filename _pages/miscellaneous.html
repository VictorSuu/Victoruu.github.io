	  Besides working with computers, I also teach <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/yoga/">Yoga</a>. </p>
	  <p>
	  From time to time, I take <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/moments/">photographs</a> when I travel.
	  I also have a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/books/">books list</a> which contains all books I am either reading, want to read, or have already read.

	  <p>
	  As a human being with needs to express oneself, I write a blog called <a href="https://gabrielchen.com/hamiltonian/">Hamiltonian</a>. Within it, I write about everything not limited to technology or computer science. I try to write articles with a high quality standard and hope you enjoy reading my pieces.

		If you would like to write something on my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/guestbook/">Guestbook</a>, that would be more than wonderful.
